function [H_e,M_sq,D] = esmG(rho,c,k,r_ms,r_lh,r_i)
% Equivalent source method in GPU implementation.
%
% [H_e,M_sq,D] = esmS(rho,c,k,r_ms,r_lh,r_i) where r_ms and r_lh are
% field and surface points respectively in three column matrices with x,
% y and z coordinates form, while r_i is a reduction factor to place
% internal points based on r_ms. Acoustic constants air density rho, 
% sound speed c, and wavenumber k must be specified. Outputs are H_e,
% M_sq, D in formula p_h = H_e v_ns and p_s = M_sq D^-1 based on the
% reference. Implementation is in GPU arrays multiplications.
